1. Working Directory (Your Local Files)
💡 What it is:

This is simply your project folder on your computer.
Whatever you create/edit/delete is in your Working Directory.

Examples:

Creating a file

echo "Code starts here" > app.js


Editing a README

Adding new folders

Removing files

Git sees three types of file states here:

Untracked (new file Git doesn’t know yet)

Modified (file changed after last commit)

Deleted

To see what Git detects:
git status

🟧 2. Staging Area (Index / Cache)
💡 What it is:

The Staging Area is like a “shopping cart” of changes you are preparing to commit.

You choose which changes should go into the next commit.

📌 Moving changes → Staging Area

Use:

git add filename


or add everything:

git add .

💡 What happened here?

Git created a snapshot of the files and stored it in the staging area.

Example:

File: app.js modified
Command:

git add app.js


Now Git is ready to commit that change.

To see staged files:
git status
Review after commit
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
1. Commit 1 made...
2. Commit 2 made...
>>>>>>> 5c3cf3d (Added Examples.txt - Commit 2)
